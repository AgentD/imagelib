  Description & history
  *********************

 This archive contains a public domain C library for loading images of
 various formats into a C-Style Array and exporting them into other formats.

 I originally started it as a simple *.tga loader for loading textures in
 small OpenGL experiments and exporting graphs from sensors attached to a
 microcontroller, but I ended up making it somewhat modular and adding more
 and more importers and exporters for other formats whenever I had time to.

 After some time, however, progress stalled and I brought myself to do a first
 small release, although I have not implemented everything I wanted to for the
 first release.

 More than a year later, after using the code for my thesis, but not working
 on it (as I ran out of boredomeness^^) I came to the conclusion that I should
 clean the code (the internals were filthy), add test suits and documentation,
 convert the hole thing from C++ to C and maybe continue working on more
 loaders/exporters.


 If you actually use this code, you can use it for whatever you want without
 any conditions whatsoever, but nevertheless, I would apreciate any hints,
 comments, bugfixes, contributions, etc... under the condition that any
 contribution goes into the public domain too.


  Features
  ********

 - public domain licensed. You can do whatever you want with my source code.
 - pure C89. It could theoretically interface with a lot of other programming
   languages.
 - should be 100% platform independend (at least MY code)
 - CMake buildsystem with lots of configuration options
 - Straight forward interface with doxygen documentation
 - Should compile out-of-the-box and can be easyly integrated into any bigger
   project
 - Support for the following image file formats:
     Loading: - Targa Image File (*.tga):
                  8 bpp gray scale with or without RLE,
                  24/32 (RGB/RGBA) bpp color mapped with or without RLE,
                  24/32 (RGB/RGBA) bpp truecolor with or without RLE
              - Windows Bitmap (*.bmp):
                  Can load everything with at least 8 bit per pixel
              - PNG's Not Gif (*.png):
                  Using LodePNG
              - JPEG interchange format (*.jpg):
                  All formats supported
                  Requires jpeglib
              - Netpbm (*.pbm, *.ppm, *.pgm, *.pnm):
                  All ASCII and binary formats

     Exporting: - Targa Image File (*.tga)
                - Windows Bitmap (*.bmp)
                - PNG's Not Gif (*.png): using LodePNG
                - JPEG interchange format (*.jpg)
                - Netpbm (*.pbm, *.ppm, *.pgm, *.pnm)

 Also note, that this archive does contain source code of third parties,
 namely LodePNG and the jpeglib library. Those libraries are not in the public
 domain and you will have to respect their terms and conditions of usage and
 redistribution if you use them. Their usage is optional and can be configured
 using the build system. The jpeg exporter is based on the public domain
 "TinyJPEG" source and does not require the jpeglib.
