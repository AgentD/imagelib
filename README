  Description & history
  *********************

 This archive contains a public domain C library for loading images of
 various formats into a C-Style Array and exporting them into other formats.

 I originally started it as a simple *.tga loader for loading textures in
 small OpenGL experiments and exporting graphs from sensors attached to a
 microcontroller, but I ended up making it somewhat modular and adding more
 and more importers and exporters for other formats whenever I had time to.

 After some time, however, progress stalled and I brought myself to do a first
 small release, although I have not implemented everything I wanted to for the
 first release.

 More than a year later, after using the code for my thesis, but not working
 of it (as I ran out of boredomeness^^) I came to the conclusion that I should
 clean the code (the internals are filthy), add test suits and documentation,
 convert the hole thing from C++ to C and maybe continue working on more
 loaders/exporters.


 Because this project (tough small) is one of my bigger out-of-boredome
 projects, I would apreciate any comments, bugfixes and contributions under
 the condition that any contribution goes into the public domain too.
 Long things short: Feel free to drop me a line: david.oberhollenzer@tele2.at.


  Features
  ********

 - public domain licensed. You can do whatever you want with my source code.
 - pure C89. It could theoretically interface with a lot of other programming
   languages.
 - should be 100% platform independend (at least MY code)
 - CMake buildsystem with lots of configuration options
 - Straight forward interface with doxygen documentation
 - Should compile out-of-the-box and can be easyly integrated into any bigger
   project
 - Support for the following image file formats:
     Loading: - Targa Image File (*.tga):
                  8 bpp gray scale with or without RLE,
                  24/32 (RGB/RGBA) bpp color mapped with or without RLE,
                  24/32 (RGB/RGBA) bpp truecolor with or without RLE
              - Windows Bitmap (*.bmp):
                  Can load everything, except 1/2/4 bpp color formats
              - PNG's Not Gif (*.png):
                  Using LodePNG
              - JPEG interchange format (*.jpg):
                  All formats supported
                  Requires jpeglib
              - ASCII Art (using a built in bitmap font)

     Exporting: - Targa Image File (*.tga)
                - Windows Bitmap (*.bmp)
                - PNG's Not Gif (*.png)
                - JPEG interchange format (*.jpg): requires libjpeg
                - ASCII Art: image to text using avarage brightness of a block
                             and optionally VT100 color codes.
